      <h2>>Piercings are often used to express culutre or self expression through the variety, along with the different method of them.</h2>
      <p>A majority of body pieacrings have orginated from ancient orgnins and different cultures. Piercings back then were more used for pure aesthetics becuase a lot of those cultrauls liked the look of the gold and silver. Body piercings have been part of human culture for thousands of years which serve various symbols through religon and aesthetic purposes. As time has went on the view of piearcings has also changed it is no longer seen and edeviance or rebellion or some sort of symbol they are more seen as a way to self express yourself further and show indivuality.</p>

        <h2>As piercings have developed so have the methods and range of piercings</h2>
        <p>As we have been able to learn more about piercings throughout the years their methods and supplies have also advanced. As we have went from using tools like bone needles we have then begun to penetrate the skin as we then eveolved to autoclaving with sterlie supplies. As piercings have grown more they became more popular in the 1970's as we were able to gain access of piercing guns and hollow needles with all sterile equipment. Overall the piearcing quipment has changed a lot over the years but that has also caused the expansion of types of piercings and a wider range for more methods.</p>
