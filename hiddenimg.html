        <p>I like hair dye because for me it is a way of self expression. Hair dye is typically some sort of liquid and based on the pigments of your hair color you are able to change it into something else. Because hair can also be shown as vibrant colors there are a lot of things to help change hair color and different methods one of the methods ive used for a while is the colorwheel, basically with semipermanent dye you will dye your hair one color and then let it fade and go onto the next color in the colorwheel. </p>
