        <p>A majority of body pieacrings have orginated from ancient orgnins and different cultures. Piercings back then were more used for pure aesthetics becuase a lot of those cultrauls liked the look of the gold and silver. Body piercings have been part of human culture for thousands of years which serve various symbols through religon and aesthetic purposes. As time has went on the view of piearcings has also changed it is no longer seen and edeviance or rebellion or some sort of symbol they are more seen as a way to self express yourself further and show indivuality. </p>

Overall the piearcing quipment has changed a lot over the years but that has also caused the expansion of types of piercings and a wider range for more methods.</p>
