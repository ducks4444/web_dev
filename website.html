        <h1>Body piearcings</h1>
        <h2>Piearcings are often used to express culutre or self expression through the variety, along with the different method of them.</h2>
        <p>A majority of body pieacrings have orginated from ancient orgnins and different cultures. Piearcings back then were more used for pure aesthetics becuase a lot of those cultrauls liked the look of the gold and silver. Body piearcings have been part of human culture for thousands of years which serve various symbols through religon and aesthetic purposes. As time has went on the view of piearcings has also changed it is no longer seen and edeviance or rebellion or some sort of symbol they are more seen as a way to self express yourself further and show indivuality. </p>
        <h2>as piearcings have developed so have the methods and range of piearcings</h2>
        <p>As we have been able to learn more about piearcings throughout the years their methods and supplies have also advanced. As we have went from using tools like bone needles we have then begun to penetrate the skin as we then eveolved to autoclaving with sterlie supplies. As piearcings have grown more they became more popular in the 1970's as we were able to gain access of piearcing guns and hollow needles with all sterile equipment. Overall the piearcing quipment has changed a lot over the years but that has also caused the expansion of types of pearcings and a wider range for more methods.</p>
