         <ol> Computer science princepals is a 7.5/10</ol>
         <p> I would personallly give the class a 7.5/10. I would do this because i think i had a hard time with doing C i had done python very well but when it had come to programming C i had to relearn a lot of things so it had slowed my process down. Once the class gets further into the units it does become easier to do as you being to get into more of a pattern. So overall i woudl give it a 7.5/10 jsut because the material is a bit harder but it does get easier and make more sense as the year goes on.</p>
